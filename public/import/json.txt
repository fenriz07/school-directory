Supporting, informing and empowering people with disability and their families is key to resolving this issue.\r\n\r\nWe build the capacity of this sector rather than focus on building our own organisation. We share knowledge, skills and leadership with other organisations.

Preserving our credibility is paramount; we are committed to integrity in our relationship with others and the presentation of facts.\r\n\r\nThe organisation has three key areas of focus:\r\n\r\nConducting and fostering research that provides an evidence base for policy change\r\nSupporting people with disability to share their stories with the Australian community to highlight the importance of our work, and keep the issue on the political agenda\r\nDeveloping integrated housing demonstration projects in order to increase the range and number of supported accommodation options.\r\n<div id=\"stcpDiv\">\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Summer Foundation is to resolve the issue of young people living in nursing homes.\r\n\r\nOur vision is that young people with disability and complex care needs will have inherent value as members of our society, with access to services and accommodation that support their health and well-being.\r\n\r\nIn Australia, approximately 200 people under 50 are admitted to aged care nursing homes each year. Young people in nursing homes want a range of creative and innovative solutions to enable them to actively participate in the community and have a real choice about where they live.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be systemic change and a dramatic increase in the number of supported housing options to avoid nursing home admissions. The key aim of the Summer Foundation is to change human service policy and practice related to young people in nursing homes. The foundation draws on a range of strategies to influence health, housing and disability services policy and practice related to this target group.\r\n\r\n<\/div>","user_email":"gina.fall@summerfoundation.org.au","user_pass":"$P$ByZVQinlXd.QBdQXRCAyDTrRNtpQ1Y\/","address":"PO BOX 208 Blackburn VIC 3130","email":"info@summerfoundation.org.au","latitude":"-37.82152614375623","longitude":"145.15195065","verified":true,"phone":"1300626560","phone_afterhours":null,"website":"http:\/\/www.summerfoundation.org.au","facebook":null,"twitter":null,"service_area":null,"monday_start":"09:00:00","monday_end":"17:00:00","tuesday_start":"09:00:00","tuesday_end":"17:00:00","wednesday_start":"09:00:00","wednesday_end":"17:00:00","thursday_start":"09:00:00","thursday_end":"17:00:00","friday_start":"09:00:00","friday_end":"17:00:00","saturday_start":"00:00:00","saturday_end":"00:00:00","sunday_start":"00:00:00","sunday_end":"00:00:00","logourl":"http:\/\/supportdirectory.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Summer-Foundation1.jpg","categories":[19]},{"title":"National Auslan Interpreter Booking &#038; Payment Service","description":"NABS is the National Auslan Interpreter Booking and Payment Service.\u00a0 NABS is funded by the Australian Government to provide interpreters FREE of charge to people who use sign language to communicate and would like to book an interpreter for private health care appointments.\r\n\r\nThis is a FREE service to Sign Language Users and Health Care Providers.\r\n\r\nAll interpreting services to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Sign Language users are provided FREE for both public and private health care appointments.","user_email":"communications@nabs.org.au","user_pass":"$P$BWphcP9wXBCIF5MVRIUx2AWtIkPVyp.","address":"930 Gympie Rd, Chermside QLD","email":"bookings@nabs.org.au","latitude":"-27.38330125822566","longitude":"153.03021294999996","verified":true,"phone":"1800246945","phone_afterhours":null,"website":"http:\/\/www.nabs.org.au","facebook":null,"twitter":null,"service_area":null,"monday_start":"08:00:00","monday_end":"20:00:00","tuesday_start":"08:00:00","tuesday_end":"20:00:00","wednesday_start":"08:00:00","wednesday_end":"20:00:00","thursday_start":"08:00:00","thursday_end":"20:00:00","friday_start":"08:00:00","friday_end":"20:00:00","saturday_start":"08:00:00","saturday_end":"13:00:00","sunday_start":"00:00:00","sunday_end":"00:00:00","logourl":"http:\/\/supportdirectory.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/NABS2.png","categories":[45]},{"title":"SHOPRIDER MOBILITY","description":"Shoprider Australia located in Perth, Western Australia is the importer and wholesaler for the SHOPRIDER BRAND of scooters, electric bikes and electric wheelchairs and distributes product throughout Australia with over 100 dealers.\r\n\r\nWe also manufacture a large range of accessories for most makes and models under the \u201cScooter Xtra\u2019s\u201d logo.\u00a0 Shoprider Australia also has access to \u00a0the extensive range of Products from \u00a0These products include Daily living Aids\u00a0 ( Walkers \/\u00a0 Electric Beds \/ Lift chairs) and Electric Pedal Assist Bikes","user_email":"Marketing@shoprider.com.au","user_pass":"$P$BQxVGWT0tMxtgUoQki1B.czQlHiLgb\/","address":"1 Business Way Malaga Western Australia    PO Box 2121, MALAGA, WA, 6944","email":"Marketing@shoprider.com.au","latitude":"-31.85502400986732","longitude":"115.89470899999992","verified":true,"phone":"1800 672 633     (08) 9248 4180","phone_afterhours":null,"website":"http:\/\/www.shoprider.com.au","facebook":null,"twitter":null,"service_area":null,"monday_start":"00:00:00","monday_end":"00:00:00","tuesday_start":"00:00:00","tuesday_end":"00:00:00","wednesday_start":"00:00:00","wednesday_end":"00:00:00","thursday_start":"00:00:00","thursday_end":"00:00:00","friday_start":"00:00:00","friday_end":"00:00:00","saturday_start":"00:00:00","saturday_end":"00:00:00","sunday_start":"00:00:00","sunday_end":"00:00:00","logourl":"http:\/\/supportdirectory.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/ShopRiderMobility.gif","categories":[33,43,56]},{"title":"Second Skin Pty Ltd","description":"Our Second Skin team consults with families, therapists and medical practitioners to prescribe, manufacture and supply custom made Compression Garments and Dynamic Splints.

I specialise in:\r\n\r\nChildren 0-18 years\r\nSpeech \u2013 Clear speech means your child can freely communicate with children and adults in his or her life.Clear speech will also asssist as your child begins to read and spell. When your child is an adult the effects of clear speech may be seen in the workplace. A business manager recently shared how he had to choose between two insurance agents identical quotes. The Insurance Agent with the clear speech won the quote. The unsuccessful insurance agent could not be clearly heard on the telephone.\r\nLanguage \u2013 Language is also an important area where a child can be assisted to understand more of what is said to him at home and in the classroom. He can also be assisted to express what he needs to say as this is not easy for all children\r\nReading, Spelling, Writing \u2013 If your child is struggling with Reading, Spelling or Writing I am very keen to assist your child in these areas. These three areas are so important to your child\u2019s overall progress at school.\r\nAutism Spectrum Disorders \u2013 Living with Autism Spectrum Disorder can be tough for children. During the last few years experts, eg Dr Tony Attwood, Dr Carol Gray, Dr Steve Gutstein and Dr Richard Eisenmajor, have shared with Speech Pathologists, such as myself, a lot of information and strategies we can learn to make a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder\u2019s life easier.\r\nRelationship Development Intervention (RDI) \u2013\u00a0RDI is one of the main interventions I use with Autism, which was devised by Steve Gutstein. See below for more information on how the RDI program works.\r\nA Speech Pathology Service on a Farm \u2013 Travelling a distance to attend a Speech Pathologist who works from her farm home may appear inconvenient. However, many parents find the warm atmosphere, with tea and coffee available, relaxing while I work with their child in a lesson, designed to be both fun and interesting for their child. The working farm can be viewed from the safe boundary of the house yard fence. Farm activities are often very motivating for the children that need the services of a Speech pathologist.","user_email":null,"user_pass":null,"address":"890 Kiata North Rd, Nhill VIC 3418, Australia","email":"fletapohlner@bigpond.com","latitude":"-36.29055846166123","longitude":"141.80863515","verified":false,"phone":"(03) 5397 4214  Mob 0417 105 820","phone_afterhours":null,"website":"http:\/\/www.fletapohlnerspeechpathology.com.au","facebook":null,"twitter":null,"service_area":null,"monday_start":"08:00:00","monday_end":"18:00:00","tuesday_start":"08:00:00","tuesday_end":"18:00:00","wednesday_start":"08:00:00","wednesday_end":"18:00:00","thursday_start":"08:00:00","thursday_end":"18:00:00","friday_start":"00:00:00","friday_end":"00:00:00","saturday_start":"00:00:00","saturday_end":"00:00:00","sunday_start":"00:00:00","sunday_end":"00:00:00","logourl":"http:\/\/supportdirectory.com.au\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/WimmeraSpeechPathology.jpg","categories":[28,50]},{"title":"Wild Rumpus Community Services","description":"Wild Rumpus Community Services provide a range of support options for children and young people who have a disability. We provide support with an emphasis on increasing skill development and social opportunities - offering individuals more flexibility and creativity in their supports. Wild Rumpus have launched a number of programs, which were developed based on the needs and interests of families we support. They include group activities on weekends, programs for pre-school aged children, camps and overnight supports, occupational therapy, case management (service coordination), after-school programs, indepdent living skills, transitional planning for young people, as well as our sibling support program - Bellarine Pizza Cats.\r\nWild Rumpus first launched in September 2012 by founding member James Asciak, who has worked for 12 years supporting young people with a disability. As The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) rolls out, we see a greater number of people with a disability have more opportunities to access meaningful supports. Since our registration with the National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA), we have seen sharp demand for our services - and work tirelessly to process all new referrals.\r\nWild Rumpus have a passion for providing innovative options in order to support people with a disability and their families in new and creative ways.

Therapists at The Neuro Practice are experienced clinicians who work with their clients to identify their therapy goals and provide expert assessment, treatment and education. In addition to neurological physiotherapy we also specialise in paediatric physiotherapy and are skilled in a range of other physio disciplines. We offer physiotherapy sessions in our easily accessible treatment rooms or provide home based therapy when it is more suited to the client's level of ability and functional needs. The Neuro Practice clinicians are able to assist with tailored home exercise programs, carer training, community hydrotherapy, gymnasium programs and prescription of customized equipment. Group therapy has commenced at The Neuro Practice to ensure greater access to prescribed exercise, strength and balance re-training to assist you with your program. The Neuro Practice has consulting rooms in Bendigo and Ballarat with specialised equipment for neurological conditions. We also cater for clients from other parts of Victoria from Shepparton and Seymour in the east to as far west as Hamilton and Portland.

We are block funded as a Multi-purpose Service (MPS) providing a wide range of clinical and community services to the catchment area from Lavers Hill to Wye River.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of our region and the challenges presented with offering services to cater for the 3,500 residents in the area (swelling to around 20,000 during the summer months) means the flexibility offered by our service is well-suited to this region.\r\n\r\nOur main challenge is our geographically isolated location. Apollo Bay is surrounded by the steep hills of the Otway Ranges and access to and from major towns is time consuming due to the steep terrain and winding road access. Travel times to Geelong are up to two hours in off peak times and are considerably longer during peak tourist times. Inland, the closest town is Colac, which is over an hours travel time, being 75 kilometres away. A lack of public transport, for all the communities in the southern part of the Colac Otway Shire, contributes to the geographic remoteness of the community.\r\n\r\nThrough our Board, Otway Health is accountable to the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government for the efficiency and integrity of operations and the quality of the services provided. Funding arrangements for multi-purpose services consist of Commonwealth and State Aged Care as well as Rural Primary Health funding. At a local level these funding arrangements facilitate a greater degree of flexibility to the MPS, allowing a range and type of appropriate services to be provided in response to the identified needs of our community.\r\n\r\nOtway Health has a joint agreement with both the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments. We are accountable to the Commonwealth and Victorian Governments for the efficiency and integrity of our operations and the quality of the services we provide.","user_email":"sforrester@swarh.vic.gov.au","user_pass":"$P$BsSDQns40Ndj5V6Uth6Gb6dFkz0UNl0","address":"75 McLachlan Street APOLLO BAY, 3233, VIC  P.O.
